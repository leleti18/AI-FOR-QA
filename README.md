## 🚀 Purpose of This Project

Modern QA engineering goes beyond traditional manual or automated testing.  
AI enables:

- Faster creation of high-quality test scenarios  
- Better understanding of logs and failure patterns  
- Risk-based prioritization  
- Consistent documentation  
- Smarter exploratory testing  

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to **real QA tasks**, using prompts and automation scripts.
